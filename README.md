Simple C# control panel for tuning PID gains.

Talks to quad over TCP on address 192.168.4.1:14550.
Expects a custom and hacky messaging format which I won't go into details of here.

TODO
  - [ ] Use mavlink messages - compatibility with QGroundControl et al.
  - [ ] Create custom mvlink messages for tuning..?
